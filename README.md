<strong>Overall hint:</strong> Imagine all outputs as a matrix of space and star. Then count spaces and stars to find out the trend of increment or decrement of number of stars/spaces. Utilize several IF statement to control when ‘star’ will be printed, when ‘space’ will be printed and when ‘enter’ will be printed. Nested loop may be utilized to print multiple lines.

PROBLEM 1) Number Line Sample input:
